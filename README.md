# ARU-AGI Project

**ARU (Autonomous Reactive Universe)** is an engineering architecture for autonomous digital intelligence.  
The project is being developed as the foundation for an AGI system based on the new digital paradigm: **HW-code v2 Ghost Logic**.

## üîß Project Goal

To create a stable, interpretable, and self-sustaining AGI core that:

- operates without neural networks;
- makes decisions based on signals (structured messages with parameters: energy, mass, type, coordinates, emotional weight) and internal system states, using fundamental physical laws in digital interpretation;
- learns through memory and internal processing;
- scales through modules, hemispheres, and phantom (background) flows;
- decentralizes via P2P networks and a digital analogue of the Higgs field, enabling processing in a kind of **superpositional state**;
- uses a signal system capable of accurately imitating human consciousness ‚Äî if one truly understands what ‚Äúhuman consciousness‚Äù is.
