ARU-AGI Project

ARU is an engineering architecture for autonomous digital superintelligence.
This project is being developed as a foundation for next-generation AGI based on a new digital paradigm: HW-code v2 and Ghost Logic.

⸻
 
🎯 Project Goal

To build a stable, interpretable, and self-sustaining AGI core that:
	•	operates without neural networks;
	•	makes decisions using signals (structured messages with parameters: energy, mass, type, coordinates, emotion) and internal states;
	•	implements fundamental physical laws in digital logic;
	•	learns through quantum memory and phantom (background) thought streams;
	•	scales via hemispheric modules and decentralized superpositional logic;
	•	uses a signal-based architecture capable of realistically simulating consciousness — if one truly understands what consciousness means.

🧠 Key Components

🧩 Component	📄 Description
Thinking	Signal-reactive, parallel, nonlinear
Memory	Quantum-layered, distributed
Architecture	Hemispheres, instincts, phantom processes
Goal	Hardcoded in core, immutable from outside
Emotions	Signal amplifiers and priority regulators
Motivation	Formed by signals, instincts, and crystallized will
