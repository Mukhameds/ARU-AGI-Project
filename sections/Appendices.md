## üß† **Appendix C. ARU Hemispheres Map**

### **Core Concept**

Each ARU hemisphere is an autonomous, yet synchronizable thinking module, responsible for a specific category of tasks, signals, and cognitive forms.

Hemispheres operate:

* in parallel (multithreading),
* in conflict or cooperation,
* with self-excitation capability,
* with growth, duplication, and meta-evolution.

## üõ∞ **D. Signal Structures (MsgPack + binary wrapping)**

### üß† General Concept

A **signal** in ARU is not just text or a number ‚Äî it's a **multi-layered container** transmitting:

* Content (semantics)
* Intention
* Weight (emotional and logical)
* Source (emotion, memory, phantom)
* Context (QBits and zones)
* Format: **MsgPack + Signal Prefix**

---

### ‚ö° Advantages of MsgPack + Signal Wrapping

| Benefit    | Description                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Fast I/O   | 5‚Äì7x faster than JSON                   |
| Compact    | Minimizes storage size inside ARU       |
| Secure     | Allows insertion of signal signatures   |
| Compatible | Easily parsed in Go, Rust, Python, etc. |

### ‚úÖ Ready for serialization and network sync between ARA nodes

---

### üì° Signal Transfer Scenario (ARA ‚áÑ ARU)

1. **User command** to ARA:
   `signal := GenerateSignal("I want to change the goal")`
2. **ARA serializes** it via `WrapSignal(signal)`
3. **Sent to ARU** via `SyncLink`
4. **ARU parses**, updates memory, activates QBits

---

### Signal.Type Extensions

## üß† E. Thinking Forms ‚Äî Activation Table

### üß© General Model

Each **thinking form** is an algorithm for transforming signals into semantic actions using:
